1)What are the differences between null and undefined?

undefined means, calue of the variable is not defined. JS has a 
global variable undefined whose value is, 'undefined' and typeof 
undefined is also 'undefined'. Remember, undefined is not a constant 
or a keyword. Undefined is a type wih exactly one value: undefined.
Assigning a new value to it does not change the value of the type
undefined.

null means empty or non-existent value which is used to indicate 'no value'.
Null is a primirtive value and you can assign null to any variable. null
is not an object, it is a primitive value. For example, you cannot add
properties to it. Sometimes poeple wrongly assume that it is an object, 
because typeof returns 'object'.

2)What are the differences between == and ===?

== will not check for type, whereas === will

3)How would you compare two objects in JavaScript?

var objectOne = {a:"super", b:"man", c: 3};
var objectTwo = {a:"super", b:"man", c: 3};

function checkObjectEquality(a,b){
  var aProps = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(a);
  var bProps = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(b);

    return false;
  } 

  for(var i=0; i<aProps.length; i++){
    var propName = aProps[i];

    if(a[propName] !== b[propName]){
      return false;
    }

  return true;
